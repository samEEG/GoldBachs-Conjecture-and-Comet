# GoldBachs-Conjecture-and-Comet
Project is inspired by the numberphile channel on YouTube. The Goldbach conjecture states that for any given even number n, there is at least one combination of two primes that equal it. When I saw Goldbach’s comet, which is the relationship that shows the total combinations of two primes that equal N, I wanted to plot it myself. 

The java file contained in this repository contains methods that can be used to plot Goldbach’s comet. 
-	Two different methods to calculate the list of primes for a given N, one being the sieve of eranthoses algorithm. 
-	Two methods to calculate the total combinations of two primes that equal N. One using a hashmap and the other using a binary search algorithm. 

The java file outputs your data to a .txt file. Use a graphing software of your choice to plot the relationship.  
Also I found it strange that I couldn’t find a list of total combinations for a given even number online, so this repository also includes my .txt file.
